# Technical-Documentation-Page
**Technical Documentation Page form: made after doing freeCodeCamp HTML course 3rd level**<br/>
Made after hard-work.<br/>
This is a replica of an existing [Technical Documentation Page](https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks/).
<br/><br/>
Also I have made it responsive according to screen sizes.
